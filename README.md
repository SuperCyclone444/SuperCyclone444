- 👋 Hi, I’m Cyclone!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning block coding on Tynker (I had to delete my Scratch account) and music on FL Studio Mobile!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FNF songs and stuff
- 📫 You can reach me through Tynker (Once again Scratch go bye-bye), BandLab, Roblox, Spotify, Geometry Dash, and Nintendo Switch!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm 14, but I'm going into 12th grade math!
